🔍 Performance Analysis & Recommendations
🚨 Critical Issues Identified
1. User Registration Bottleneck

Issue: 2.6 second average response time
Impact: Poor user experience during signup
Recommendation:

Optimize database queries
Implement connection pooling
Consider async processing for non-critical operations

2. Login Performance

Issue: 1.1 second response time
Impact: Slow authentication process
Recommendation:

Implement Redis caching
Optimize session management
Database index optimization

3. Bandwidth Utilization
Issue: High data transfer for product browsing (48KB/sec)
Impact: Slower page loads, higher costs

Recommendation:
Image compression and optimization
Implement CDN
Lazy loading for images

✅ Strengths Observed

Perfect Reliability: 0% error rate across all scenarios
Consistent Performance: Low standard deviation for most operations
Scalable Architecture: Handles 50 concurrent users efficiently

📈 Future Enhancements
🎯 Planned Features
